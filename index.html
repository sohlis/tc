      <h2>About</h2>
<p>
  We at Triple Clear care about water. We understand its importance and we are dedicated to the science of clean water. Stunningly, less than 1% of the water on Earth is freshwater readily available for drinking. Meanwhile, more than 400 billion gallons of water are used each day in the USA alone!
</p>
<p>
  These facts, combined with an overall effort to reduce the waste caused by the nearly 50 billion empty bottles of water thrown away each year (just in America) at a huge cost both to the economy and the environment, create a market situation where the demand for innovative water solutions is critical.
</p>
<p>
  Triple Clear Water Solutions is focused on providing solutions for commercial, industrial, and consumer applications that provide cost-effective ways to provide impeccable, clean, and delicious water using patented technologies and simplified installations.
</p>
<p>
  Our productized solutions allow our customers to easily solve the most common, and the most difficult, water purification challenges. By selling pre-packaged solutions that are “plug and play” we can reduce costs for our clients, simplify the purchasing cycle, and completely solve their water challenges in a way that provides exceptional ROI.

        <h2>Triple Clear Technology</h2>
          <p><em>Triple Clear’s Force Field&#8482; Filtering technology is at the heart of our solutions.</em></p>
        <h4>What is Force Field&#8482; Technology?</h4>
        <p>
          We use an electrodsorptive technology for water purification and filtration.  Our filters remove a wide range of submicron particulates, pathogens, trace pharmaceuticals and cellular debris with its naturally occurring electropositive charge.
          Force Field Filter&#8482; are specifically engineered to have this charge field cover the entire depth and void volume of the media. By accomplishing submicron “filtration” with a charge field rather than with mechanical pores, Force Field Filters have a small fraction of the pressure drop and many times the flow rate when compared to ultrafiltration membranes having similar efficiency.
        </p>
        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>
          In layman’s terms, all filters have holes that allow water to pass through.  If you make the holes small enough, the good stuff can pass, but the bad stuff (like viruses and bacteria) cannot.  The problem is, that holes that small slow the flow of the water substantially and clog easily.  Our technology uses science to essentially create a “force field” over the holes in filter.  This “force field” has the ability to keep out bad stuff, but has no effect of good stuff.  That allows for our filters to have bigger holes, allowing for better flow and massively decreased maintenance, while still being incredibly effective at stopping bacteria and viruses from passing through.
        </p>
        <h4>How powerful is it?</h4>
        <p>
          Independent testing has shown Force Field Filter&#8482; to reduce MS2 virus at greater than 99.99%. It can remove a wide range of bacteria at greater than 99.9999% including; E. coli, Pseudomonas and Legionella. Removal of 3 micron spheres (as a surrogate for cryptosporidium) is greater than 99.95% efficiency. Force Field Filter&#8482; has been proven to remove certain species of colloidal metals, hazardous compounds such as PCB’s and trace pharmaceuticals including BPH, a known hormone inhibitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Independent university testing has shown Force Field Filter’s&#8482; combination of electroadsorption and depth filtration to effectively reduce low molecular weight organic acids and polysaccharides from fresh, brackish and salt water. These organic materials are now considered to be the main causes of fouling for hollow fiber and reverse osmosis membranes.  In other words, our filters are much harder to clog.
        </p>

        <h4>Force Field Filters&#8482;: Electroadsorptive technology for water purification and filtration. </h4>

Force Field Filters&#8482; is specifically engineered to have this charge field cover the entire depth and void volume of the media.

Performance Independent testing has shown Force Field Filters&#8482; to reduce MS2 virus at greater than 99.99%. It can remove a wide range of bacteria at greater than 99.9999% including; E. coli, Pseudomonas and Legionella. Removal of 3 micron spheres (as a surrogate for cryptosporidium) is greater than 99.95% efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Force Field Filters&#8482; has been proven to remove certain species of colloidal metals, hazardous compounds such as PCB’s and trace pharmaceuticals including BPA, a known hormone inhibitor. University testing has shown Force Field Filter’s&#8482; combination of electroadsorption and depth filtration to effectively reduce low molecular weight organic acids and polysaccharides from fresh, brackish and salt water. These organic materials are now considered the main cause of fouling for hollow fiber and reverse osmosis membranes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our unique Force Field Filters&#8482; technology is creating many new application opportunities across the entire spectrum of water filtration. With the filtration efficiency of ultrafiltration membranes and the pressure drop of a 2 micron non-woven media, Force Field Filters® can be considered as an alternative for membranes in many residential, commercial and industrial applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          PAC Force Field Filters&#8482; also contains powdered activated carbon (PAC) with an average particle size of only 8 microns. Activated carbon at this particle size has a very high pore size to weight ratio, which produces remarkably high dynamic adsorption. Force Field Filters&#8482; use no adhesives or binders to retain the carbon, therefore significantly more active sites remain available for adsorption of chlorine, iodine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), disinfection by-products (DPBs) and organic acids from water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Force Field Filters&#8482; with Silver are naturally non-toxic, and highly effective in removing bacteria from water without inactivating the retained bacteria. For applications that require growth inhibition of bacteria retained by the media, all Force Field Filters&#8482; grades are available with a silver treatment registered to be safe for use in potable water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Force Field Filters&#8482; High Flow is designed with a large pore volume that is not totally covered by the boehmite charge field. This feature reduces the efficiency of the media but increases its capacity for colloid, particulate and organic acid loading. When High Flow is used as a prefilter to our standard Force Field Filters&#8482; grades in more turbid waters the life and efficiency of the two-layers significantly outperforms a single layer of Force Field Filters&#8482;. High Flow can also be used as a stand-alone filter when high levels of organic contaminants must be removed, such as to protect reverse osmosis membranes from biofouling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Force Field Filters&#8482; are based on the naturally occurring element boehmite which has no known HSE issues. Boehmite has long been used as an additive to food products, digestive analgesics, industrial applications and as an adjuvant for human vaccines.
