                <h2>About Triple Clear</h2>
                <p>We at Triple Clear care about water.  We understand its importance and we are dedicated to the science of clean water.  Our founder was backpacking through Africa when he saw the devastation that a lack of clean water can have on people and their communities.  He made it his life’s mission to find a better way to treat water and make it safe for people and the environment.</p>

                <p>Years of study lead him down a path where he found answers.  Amazingly, he found the answer in the science of nanotechnology.  There, he found a way to create an entirely new molecule.  A molecule that is not only completely natural and organic, but also has the nearly magical ability to purify water without the use of any chlorine, chemicals or electricity.</p>

                <p>It is our mission to share this technology with the world providing efficient, effective water treatment solutions from the smallest to the largest scale.</p>

                <h2>Triple Clear Technology</h2>

                <p>Triple Clear Powder (TCP) is a filtration media based on nanotechnology. It starts with coconut shells which are converted to grains of highly porous carbon base material.  Then, using a proprietary method based on technologies created for the semiconductor industry, they are plated with high purity elements.</p>

                <p>The result?  One gram of Triple Clear Powder has an internal adsorptive surface area equivalent to a Soccer field!</p>

                <p>This is more than 8x the normal absorptive qualities of activated carbon.  It’s like a “super sponge.” Plus, unlike normal granular activated carbon, our patented process leaves every grain with both bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties.  This means it doesn’t just kill bacteria, it keeps killing bacteria for days after treatment, while leaving no chemicals or ions in the water.  We kill bacteria using just oxygen!</p>

                 <p>Using no electricity or chemicals, Triple Clear: Filters and suppresses heavy metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides, nitrates, micro-pollutants, oxidation byproducts, detergents, other harmful chemical products, coloring, tastes and odors; Oxidizes toxins and bacteria on contact, including bacteria that are resistant to chlorine, such as Legionella Pneumophila and, amazingly, because of its residual properties, it preserves water naturally and protects for an extended time period against recontamination It’s not only the most effective process available, it’s completely GREEN!</p>

                <h4>Why is Triple Clear the best technology?</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Versus Reverse Osmosis (RO)</li> 
                    <li>RO doesn’t destroy bacteria…in fact, it often increases bacteria</li>
                    <li>RO uses both electricity and chemicals</li>
                    <li>Versus Ordinary Granulated Active Carbon (GAC)</li>
                    <li>Triple Clear Powder has 8x the surface area of ordinary GAC per gram</li>
                    <li>Ordinary GAC has no ability to kill bacteria…in fact, bacteria often builds up in GAC</li>
                    <li>Versus UV</li>
                    <li>Triple Clear Powder requires no electricity</li>
                    <li>Unlike Triple Clear Powder UV is not bacteriostatic…meaning bacteria will begin growing again immediately after treatment</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Triple Clear key benefits</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Triple Clear powder</li> 
                    <li>works instantly on contact</li>
                    <li>Keeps working, killing bacteria even after treatment is finished</li>
                    <li>Leaves the “good” in the water. It doesn’t remove all of the (Natural ) minerals that are good for human consumption and give water its nutrients and flavor. In fact, the hyper-oxygenated water is even healthier!</li>
                    <li>Requires no electricity and very little maintenance </li>
                    <li>Is completely scalable from a single use tap to enormous industrial tanks</li>
                    <li>Is environmentally inert. A truly GREEN technology.</li>
                    <li>Triple Clear Powder requires no electricity</li>

                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <p>Triple Clear Powder (TCP) is available in bulk powder, as block, in our standard filter housings, or in our custom developed filter housings.  We easily scale our offerings from home use all the way to mission critical industrial applications.  Our Triple Clear based solutions are perfect for:</p>

                <h4>Potable Water</h4>
                <p>Drinking water filtered by Triple Clear is pure, healthy, and delicious.  The quality exceeds the quality of most bottled waters and provides a Green and cost-effective alternative.  Whether polishing tap water for taste and bacteria, or cleaning truly contaminated well water, Triple Clear delivers exceptional results.</p>
                <h4>Aquaculture</h4>
                <p>TCP has been tested in aquaculture production, specifically shrimp farming and fish aquariums. Because of the increased oxygen level and quality of the treated water, the results were significant in terms of yield and quality of the cultivated shrimp and fish.</p>
                <h4>Agriculture</h4>
                <p>TCP has been tested with certain agricultural crops, again with extraordinary results. It may be possible that, by providing oxygen enriched water over time, the use of nitrate based fertilizers could be dramatically reduced as it improves the microbiological environment and so the production. TCP even removes all traces of nitrates from the water.</p>
                <h4>Swimming Pool Filtration</h4>
                <p>TCP eliminates the need for any chemical treatment of pool water, and will also eliminate the substances listed above together with bacteria and human secretions. Its use will prove more cost effective than the traditional chemical additive systems, is environmentally friendly, and can be retrofitted to existing filtration systems.</p> 
                <h4>Biofilms & Industrial Fluids</h4>
                <p>Triple Clear has entered into various joint development programs with several multi-national corporations to explore filtration and sterilization opportunities in agriculture and biofilm in the petroleum industries.  Fluids, including oils and cooling liquids, used in closed loop systems requires frequent system maintenance due to the presence of bacteria.  In addition, the presence of bacteria can affect the properties of the fluid media.The use of Triple Clear Powder offers significant potential for cost savings by canceling the biofilm, resulting in a corresponding reduction in down time and loss of production.</p>

                <h2>The Science</h2>
                <h4>Triple Clear Powder is more than just Granulated Active Carbon (GAC)!</h4>
                <p>The grafting of very high purity metals onto the internal and external micro-pore surfaces of the active carbon is done through a proprietary process derived upon technologies created for the semiconductor industry. Our Chief Science Officer developed the hardware systems and processes in-house using ground-breaking techniques from the nano-scale semiconductor industry.</p>

                <p>The deposits obtained on the GAC is said to be "in thin layers" with controlled thickness of a few dozens angstroms. The catalytic elements are covalently bonded (i.e., strong atomic bonds) to the virgin active carbon, and due to the purity of the materials deposited provide stability to the metallic ions and will not induce metal oxidation, which assures an excellent reactivity in water.</p>

                <p>The net result is that Triple Clear Powder combines the well-known adsorptive qualities of granulated activated carbon with the immediate bactericidal and bacteriostatic qualities.</p>

                <p>Without the use of electricity or a photo source (example ~ UV light), the natural catalytic reaction created by water flowing through the Triple Clear Powder purifies water to a certifiable potable state**, with the added benefits of oxidizing toxins and bacteria on contact (including bacteria that are resistant to chlorine, such as Legionella Pneumophila) and preserves water naturally for an extended period of time against recontamination.</p>
